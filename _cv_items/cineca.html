During and after high school, I worked as an intern for 
<a href="https://www.cineca.it/en" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CINECA</a>
(the largest Italian computing centre) as a Python programmer.
My primary responsibility was to assist in the development of BVTK, 
an add-on for Blender that enables integration with the 
scientific visualization library VTK (the source is available
<a href="https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/sci_vis" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
