During and after high school, I worked as an intern for 
<a href="https://www.cineca.it/en" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CINECA</a>
(the largest Italian comnputing centre) as a Python programmer.
I have helped develop an add-on for Blender that allows integrations
with the scientific visualization library VTK.
