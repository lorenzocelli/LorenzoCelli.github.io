role: Python developer
period: "2019"

During April 2019 I took part, with the help of CINECA and CNR, to the 
<a href="https://esowc.ecmwf.int/" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summer of weather code</a>, 
a programme run by <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECMWF</a>
(European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) to develop innovative, open-source software.
I had the oppurtunity to work with ECMWF again in November 2019, this time to create some animations
that were displayed at the annual AGU (American Geophysical Union) meeting.
