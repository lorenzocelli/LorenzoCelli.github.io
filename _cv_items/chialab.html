<a href="https://www.chialab.it/lang/eng" class="link-unstyled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chialab</a>, 
is a graphic design studio based in Bologna. I worked there as
an intern for a few months during the summer in 2018 and 2019,
mainly working as a web developer on two web applications
that were never released. Starting out from the experience at Chialab,
I was able to develop the front-end and back-end of the website
