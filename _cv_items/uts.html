Thanks to a scolarship offered by Unibo as a part of their <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/international/Studying-abroad/General-information-on-Overseas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overseas program</a>, 
in 2021/2022 I studied abroad for one year (however, due to the COVID pandemic, the first six months of the program were conducted remotely), at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Technology Sydney</a>.
